Welcome to biops's documentation!
=================================
biops (bioprocess simulator) is a python package for simulating the function of biological reactors commonly used in wastewater treatment.

With biops, the activities of ordinary heterotrophic bacteria (OHO), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB),
nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), anammox, and comammox can be simulated in suspended growth- and biofilm reactors.
